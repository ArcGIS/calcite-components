# Contributing to calcite-design-tokens

You want to contribute? Nice! Below are some guidelines for ensuring that your contribution makes sense for everybody.

## Reporting Issues

Found a problem? Want a new feature?

- See if your issue or idea has [already been reported](issues).
- Provide detailed reproduction instructions as well as what behavior is expected.

## Contributing to tokens

### Clone the repo

To begin, [fork this project](fork), clone your fork, and add our upstream.

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/calcite-design-tokens
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd calcite-design-tokens
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/esri/calcite-design-tokens
# Install the tools necessary for development
npm install
```

### Create a branch for your feature or fix

If you are a designer setting up a branch for Figma Tokens Plugin, make sure your branch name starts with `designer/`.

```bash
git checkout -b designer/[yourname]
```

or use the calcite default branching pattern

```bash
git checkout -b [yourname]/[type]-[issue#]
```

### Setup the project

#### install

`npm install`

#### build

Build the tokens to platform assets

`npm run build`


## Understanding Token Files

All token files may be updated by the Figma Token Studio plugin. These can also be updated in the code directly. Any changes to token files must be reviewed by the Calcite Design Team.

### tokens/$metadata.json

This file is used by Figma Token Studio but is not used to determine final token asset output.

### tokens/$themes.json

Each theme defined in this file will output a token asset in each format defined in the token transformer config.

### tokens/core.json

The core design tokens upon which the rest of the tokens are built.

### tokens/semantic.json

The semantic design tokens used by theme files and components.

### tokens/component/

The component design tokens. These are used by themes.

### tokens/calcite/

The Calcite themes. This currently consists of a light and dark theme.


## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are the greatest contributions, so be sure they are focused in scope.

### Be sure your code passes our integration and unit tests

```bash
# Test current code
npm run test
```

### Push your branch up to your fork

```bash
# Push a designer branch
git push origin designer/[yourname]
```

```bash
# Push a developer branch
git push origin [yourname]/[type]-[issue#]
```

### Open the pull request back to the token repo

Make sure to use a clear title and description. See [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for more information.

## Bumping the Version

1. Following the rules of [SEMVER](https://semver.org/), change the version number in `package.json` to the appropriate version number.
2. Write a description of the changes, additions, and bug fixes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Run `npm run build` to make sure the `dist/` files are updated.
4. Make sure `Esri/calcite-design-tokens` is up-to-date with your changes (via Pull Request).
5. Run `npm run release`. If prompted enter your GitHub credentials.

## CI Automation

Github actions facilitate the token handoff between the Designers using the Figma Tokens Plugin and a multi-branch git repo.

Designers using the Figma Token Plugin should set their watched git repo to `designers/[custom-name]`.

### design-tokens-pr.yml

This file allows designers to each work off their own branch. Helping prevent accidental overwrites from other people working on the same tokens files.

Automated Steps

1. Watches for changes to any branch in the repo named `designers/*`.
1. Generate a pull request with new changes to the set feature branch.

### Wait for reviewers

Await reviews from the team before merging the new work from designers into the feature branch. This allows time for discussion and alignment on bug fixes, features, and potential breaking changes before merging.

### design-tokens-sync.yml

When changes are detected on the feature branch, generate a pull-request back to the designer branches. This avoids the burden on designers to have to switch between branches in the Figma Token plugin and ensuring any conflicts between each designer's branch and the feature branch do not accidentally overwrite the designers work.

Automated Steps

1. Watch for changes on the feature branch.
1. Open pull-requests to each of the designer branches set in the action file.
1. Add `automated-tokens-pr'` label.

### design-tokens-automerge.yml

Auto merge pull requests created with the label `automated-tokens-pr`.

Automated Steps

1. Watch for pull requests with the label `automated-tokens-pr`.
1. Wait to confirm the pull request passes required checks.
1. Merge the pull request with the commit message `chore: automatic merge`.
