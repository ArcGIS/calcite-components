# Calcite Tailwind

The calcite-tailwind repository holds the tailwind configuration used to build calcite-components.

:warning: Warning! :warning:

> This package is currently in its very early stages of development. The Tailwind config will change as we begin to adopt it. Until version 1.0.0 minor versions could contain breaking changes to class names!

## Install

If you use npm, installation is as easy as:

```
npm install @esri/calcite-tailwind
```

You can also [download the latest release manually](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-tailwind/releases).

_Note_: this project assumes you have the light and dark theme variables defined on your page. If you're using calcite components, these will already be defined for you. If not, please see [calcite-colors](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-colors/) for steps on how to import the theme.

### PostCSS/Tailwind

To add Calcite's Tailwind configuration to your project you can simply import it in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
var calciteTheme = require("@esri/calcite-tailwind");

module.exports = {
  purge: ["./public/**/*.html"], // make sure to purge any unused CSS by passing in your HTML here
  ...calciteTheme
};
```

### CSS

A static CSS file is also provided at `dist/tailwind.css`. When using this option it's a good idea to use nano or another CSS optimization tool to remove the unused classes as the default build can be quite large.


### Use

In HTML, you can use the classes directly:

```html
<div class="container">
  <p class="font-medium text-0 mb-4">
</div>
```

If you'd like to add styles from the tailwind set to an existing set, you can use `@apply`:

```css
.my-class {
  @apply font-medium text-0 mb-4;
}
```

_Note_: this requires you set up via PostCSS (see above).

### Tips

If you're a VS Code user, the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin will provide auto-complete for the classes, making it much faster to develop styles!
