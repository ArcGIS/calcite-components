const r = "# Internationalization (i18n)\n\nTypically, components allow users to supply text values via slots and attributes, but there are cases where components need to take additional steps to support internationalization.\n\n## Formatting\n\nFormatting of values, such as numbers and dates, for display should use the [`Intl` APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl).\n\n### Styling/Layout\n\nTo add right-to-left (RTL) support to your components you should use [CSS Logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) within CSS. If you need to know direction in JavaScript, use the internal `getElementDir` helper in the dom utility.\n\nSome CSS properties do not have logical equivalents. Such as...\n\n- box-shadow\n- text-shadow\n- transform\n- background-position\n\nFor these properties, you should use the internal `getElementDir` helper to apply the `CSS_UTILITY.rtl` class to your component.\n\n## Translation (t9n)\n\nPreviously, components provided Intl properties (`intl<Prop>`) to allow users to pass string translations. While this is still supported for backwards compatibility, our components also have translations built-in.\n\nThe following section covers how to add built-in translation support to components.\n\n### `T9nComponent` pattern\n\nThis pattern enables components to support built-in translations. In order to support this, a component must:\n\n1. Add the following translation bundles as component assets under a `t9n` folder (please refer to <https://github.com/Esri/calcite-design-system/blob/dev/packages/calcite-components/conventions/README.md#assets> for additional info on assets)\n   1. `messages.json` ‚Äì main bundle\n   2. `messages_en.json` ‚Äì locale-specific bundle (kept in sync with main one via scripts)\n2. Implement the `T9nComponent` interface\n   1. The `onMessagesChange` method must be empty as it is wired up by the support utils.\n   2. The `onMessagesChange` method must also be configured to watch the `messageOverrides` property.\n3. Use the `setUpMessages` util in the component's `componentWillLoad` lifecycle methods. This must be awaited on to have an initial set of strings available before rendering.\n4. Use the `connectMessages`/`disconnectMessages` utils in the component's `connectedCallback`/`disconnectedCallback` lifecycle methods. This will set up and tear down supporting methods on the component.\n5. Add an appropriate E2E test by using the `t9n` common test helper.\n6. Composite components need to forward message overrides props to supporting t9n components.\n   1. If the parent supports translations:\n      1. Add the `messageOverrides` property (its type should be the union of the parent and supporting component messages types).\n      2. Pass the `messageOverrides` into supporting components in the render method.\n   1. If the parent does not support translations:\n      1. Add the `messageOverrides` property (its type should be the union of supporting component messages types).\n      2. Pass the `messageOverrides` into supporting components in the render method.\n7. Internal components that support public t9n components\n   1. Do not have to implement the `T9nComponent` interface\n   2. Should use an internal, immutable, `messages` property (its type should correspond to the parent component's messages type)\n\n#### Notes\n\n- This pattern depends on `LocalizedComponent` being implemented.\n- `connectLocalized` (from `LocalizedComponent`) must be called before `connectMessages`.\n- You can also look at the interface and util documentation for additional info.\n- The internal `messages` property should be used as the source of truth for translations in rendering.\n- List of supported locales can be found on our [Localization support page](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/localization/#locale-support).\n- Placeholders in message bundle strings should:\n  - Use the following syntax: `{placeholder}` (e.g., `Hello {userName}, my old friend. üëã`).\n  - Have an expressive name to provide context regarding its use.\n\n## Translated strings\n\n**Note ‚ö†Ô∏è**: this pattern is deprecated and should no longer be followed for future components!\n\nIn the future it will likely become necessary to provide string translations for components. An example would be the `aria-label` for the `<calcite-modal>` close button. Initial research looks promising and we could likely implement one of these approaches and set a `lang` for each component.\n\n- <https://medium.com/stencil-tricks/implementing-internationalisation-i18n-with-stencil-5e6559554117> and <https://codesandbox.io/s/43pmx55vo9>\n- <https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-stencil-conference-app/issues/69>\n\nUntil we implement a `lang` facility and set up translations for all components, we have been allowing a small number of strings to be passed in as properties. Properties that represent translated strings should have the syntax: `text-label-x`, where `x` is the name for the string. For example, when providing a string from \"Close\", use the property name `text-label-close`. In the component, these properties should default to their English equivalent (this is useful for non-localized apps):\n\n```tsx\n@Prop() textLabelClose: string = 'Close';\n```\n";
function o(n) {
  return e.jsxs(e.Fragment, {
    children: [e.jsx(s, {
      title: "Overview/Internationalization"
    }), `
`, e.jsx(a, {
      children: r
    })]
  });
}
function c(n = {}) {
  const { wrapper: t } = {
    ...i(),
    ...n.components
  };
  return t ? e.jsx(t, {
    ...n,
    children: e.jsx(o, {
      ...n
    })
  }) : o();
}
export {
  c as default
};
