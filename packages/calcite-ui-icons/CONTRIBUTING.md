# Contributing to calcite-ui-icons

The Creative Lab at Esri is the primary contributor to the icons provided in `@esri/calcite-ui-icons`.

## Running the Doc Site

First install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

This will optimize the icons, create a JSON file with all the icon path data, and start up a development server with live reload capabilities.

This task also watches for changes and rebuilds the JSON file whenever icons are added or edited, automatically reloading your browser to display changes as they come in.

**Mac users can also double click `launch`, which runs the commands above.**
