# Custom theme

Developers building Esri applications are encouraged to use the default light or dark themes as much as possible. However, CSS varialbes defining color and typography are exposed on `:root` and may be customized as shown in this example.

```html
<style>
  .my-theme {
    --calcite-ui-text-3: white;
    --calcite-ui-foreground-1: red;
  }
</style>
<div class="my-theme">
  <calcite-action icon="beaker" text="Foo" text-enabled></calcite-action>
</div>
```

CalciteAction uses `--calcite-ui-foreground-1` and `--calcite-ui-text-3` for its default appearance. Overwriting thosee variable will customize the appearance of all instances of CalciteAction inside the div.

Note that setting the `theme` property individual components or elements will prevent overwrites from taking effect.

```html
<style>
  .my-theme {
    --calcite-ui-text-3: white;
    --calcite-ui-foreground-1: red;
  }
</style>
<div class="my-theme">
    <calcite-action icon="beaker" text="Foo" text-enabled></calcite-action>

    <!-- The theme property will prevent this from recieving the overwrites. -->
    <calcite-action theme="light" icon="beaker" text="Bar" text-enabled></calcite-action>
</div>
```
Setting a valid theme prop ("light" or "dark") prevents application overwrites from taking effect.
